# Java-PTM1-Final-Project
BSc - Advanced Software Development 1 - Java

The Goal - Creating the server side of a software that resolves the Fastest way
through a Graph while keep using all the design patterns learned in the course.

In this project I used Best First Search algorithm to reasolve the problem but
other algorithms like A Star, BFS and others can be implement Searcher and be used
to reasolve graphs.
